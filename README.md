# Face_Recognition_Adversarial_training
This project implements a real-time face recognition system using deep learning, with capabilities to simulate and detect adversarial attacks via the Reface method. It demonstrates vulnerabilities in face recognition models and proposes basic defenses. Developed as part of the Master WISD program at USMBA in FÃ¨s.
